This repository contains code for Expense Expert, a web application for Finance Track of WildHacks 2025. The team consists of Aditya Yellapuntula Venkata, Swapnil Gore, Anirudh Jagannath, and Adin Lieblein.  
For our database, we used the MongoDB framework with Mongoose for high level, tactful data management. It shares an NPM project with an Express API, which abstracted the data  
processing for the FastAPI which worked closely with Google's Gemini API. In python, we are deploying our api server locally with the help of uvicorn. We used pillow for  
processing images before sending them to Gemini. The frontend is built on React framework.
